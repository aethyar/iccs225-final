## Database Project

---

## Coffee Shop Software System

## About the Business
> This business is centred around providing a cosy environment for patrons to enjoy quality coffee, pastries, and other refreshments.

## Purposes
> The proposed database system aims to streamline operations and enhance efficiency by:
> 1. Managing inventory seamlessly, allowing staff to freely adjust ingredient quantities as needed.
> 2. Additionally, it should centralise staff information, including schedules and shifts, to facilitate smoother coordination and scheduling.
> 3. This system will empower the coffee shop to better serve its customers while optimising internal processes.
> 4. The system will allow users to add more types of ingredients easily.
> 5. The system will allow users to add or remove staff and modify their information easily.
> 6. This system will alert users on when the ingredients are sub-par or below the required quantities.
> 7. The system will show the current employees shift at the current time for easy access as well as have an attendance checker.
 
Once implemented, the coffee shop business should have the right tools to be organised and professional while ensuring there will not be problems with the inventory.
